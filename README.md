# SecureCartography - NetBox Import Wizard

A PyQt6-based GUI wizard for importing network topology data from SecureCartography JSON files into NetBox DCIM (Data Center Infrastructure Management) systems.

## Overview

The NetBox Import Wizard bridges the gap between network discovery tools and NetBox inventory management by providing an intuitive interface for importing discovered network devices, their connections, and metadata into NetBox. This significantly reduces the manual effort required to populate NetBox with real-world network topology data.

## Current Status: Production Ready - Core Functions Complete

## Technical Architecture

### Dependencies
- **PyQt6**: Modern Qt6-based GUI framework with threading support
- **pynetbox**: NetBox API client library
- **urllib3**: HTTP library with SSL warning suppression
- **requests**: HTTP session management for SSL configuration

### Key Components

**Threading Classes:**
- **NetBoxConnectionThread**: Non-blocking connection testing
- **TopologyLoadThread**: Asynchronous file loading with progress
- **NetBoxDataThread**: Background NetBox data fetching
- **DeviceImportThread**: Threaded device creation with cancellation support

**Core Classes:**
- **NetBoxAPI**: Wrapper around pynetbox with SSL configuration and caching
- **DeviceDiscoveryModel**: JSON topology parsing, validation, and device matching
- **DeviceTableWidget**: Custom table with embedded combo boxes and status visualization
- **NetBoxImportWizard**: Main application coordinating all components

### Threading Architecture
The application uses Qt's threading system to prevent UI blocking:
- All API calls run in separate QThread instances
- Progress signals provide real-time feedback
- Proper thread lifecycle management with cleanup
- UI remains responsive during all operations

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install PyQt6 pynetbox requests urllib3
```

### Configuration
1. **NetBox Setup**: Ensure NetBox API is accessible and API token has appropriate permissions:
   - `dcim.view_site`
   - `dcim.view_devicerole`
   - `dcim.view_devicetype`
   - `dcim.view_manufacturer`
   - `dcim.view_device`
   - `dcim.view_platform`
   - `dcim.add_device` (for import functionality)

2. **SSL Configuration**: For lab environments with self-signed certificates, leave "Verify SSL Certificate" unchecked

### Usage
```bash
python nbwiz.py
```

## Topology File Format

The wizard expects JSON files with the following structure:

```json
{
  "device-name": {
    "node_details": {
      "ip": "10.1.1.1",
      "platform": "C9407R"
    },
    "peers": {
      "peer-device": {
        "ip": "10.1.1.2", 
        "platform": "C9200L-48P-4X",
        "connections": [
          ["Gi1/0/1", "Te1/1/4"],
          ["Gi1/0/2", "Te1/1/3"]
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Field Requirements:**
- All fields are optional with comprehensive error handling
- Missing `node_details`, `peers`, or connection data handled gracefully
- Platform strings extracted for device type mapping
- IP addresses enable device matching in NetBox
- Peer devices automatically discovered and added to device list

## Contributing

The project is in active development. Key areas for contribution:

1. **Platform Intelligence**: Develop smart mapping between discovered platforms and NetBox device types
2. **Connection Processing**: Implement cable/interface creation from topology data
3. **UI Enhancement**: Add advanced filtering, search, and bulk operations
4. **Error Handling**: Improve validation and recovery mechanisms

## Architecture Decisions

**Threading Model**: Uses Qt's QThread system for true parallelism while maintaining thread safety and proper UI updates.

**SSL Handling**: Defaults to disabled SSL verification to support common lab environments while maintaining production security options.

**Caching Strategy**: Aggressive caching of NetBox API responses with manual refresh capability to balance performance and data freshness.

**Error Recovery**: Comprehensive validation and normalization throughout the data pipeline to handle real-world topology files with inconsistent data.

**Progress Feedback**: Multi-level progress indication from file operations through API calls to provide transparency in long-running operations.

## Testing Environment

Successfully validated against:
- NetBox 3.x instances with production-scale data
- Complex network topologies with mixed vendor equipment
- Self-signed SSL certificates in lab environments
- Large topology files (100+ devices)
- Concurrent operations and stress testing

The wizard provides a robust, production-ready solution for bulk NetBox device import with comprehensive error handling and user feedback.
